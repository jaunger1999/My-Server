#Tekken 8: It loves frame advantage and hates knockdowns :/

Tekken 8 has a lot of great changes. Throws and parries are no longer useless on paper. Counter hits no longer dominate the meta so people are less scared to approach and press buttons.

Heat grants full control of the match for a short time, reducing how much random bullshit you'll endure against unpredictable (scrubby) players. It lets you both push your advantage and come back from a disadvantage.

Movement is my favorite mechanic in action games.


I love knockdowns. If I knock down my opponent, I get to pressure them. I can bait out defensive options and punish. I can secure better positioning such that they have their back to a wall. I can assume they'll respect me and go for a 50/50. If they stay on the ground I get free damage.

If I land a heat engager, I go mid or low.
If I do a heat dash, I go mid or low or wait for a rage art. The thing I hate most about heat dashes is that everyone get a free no-skill approach into frame advantage (a free 50/50), and makes all heat engagers practically the same move while heat is active.

My favorite characters in Tekken 7 were fundamentally changed by Tekken 8's system changes. Keep in mind that the main thing I liked about these characters is that they were strong at close range, but had to work hard to get there.

King: I don't see people go for oki after throws anymore. The whole premise of a grappler trying to work their way to range zero for a 50/50 is gone. King just gets 50/50s for free now. The heat smash 50/50 happens basically every round. The way characters tracked tech rolls while hopping over them changed, so those setups are gone. (I think this was done to nerf Akuma in T7?)

Steve: db3,2 doesn't knock down anymore, so he gets loopable pressure. 3+4,2 seems to always hit people for some reason. So, basically he get another free 50/50.

Kazuya: No db2 knockdown. ff2 means people don't want to step as much. So, he gets brainless 50/50s.

Dragunov: A lockdown character now has a full crouch mixup and hatchet kick. Literally why. If all he got was the unbreakable gimmick throws in heat he would've been perfect due to chip damage synergizing with his frames. Instead they nerfed my favorite move in all of Tekken (wr2) into the ground and gave him a bunch of broken garbage that's less fun. It's also sad his tackle can only be accessed through strings now. He was my main in Tekken 7 and I want to learn a different character now. I still like him but not nearly as much.


I decided I need to find something new to like about Tekken 8. I've explored Raven, Nina, and Lee a tad. They all seem interesting as they either focus on movement or keepout instead of forcing mixups. The result is games that involve more movement and a bit less button pressing.

Raven has a good backbash, and moves that recover fast on whiff which makes for a solid gameplan built around baits. He has a varied mixup game when he is up close. However, he has so many mixups and moves that can be disguised as others, that rather than being a simple 50/50 characater, he is more of a mental-stack character. You never have to repeat a mixup; there is always an additional layer you can add.

The only thing I don't like about Lee is that his slide puts him directly in the enemy's face. In T7 his slide knocked down and away so the game reset to neutral.

Nina seems strongest at range 1, rather than 0. Her backsway and pokes seem to make up the bulk of her gameplan, so she seems fun.
